            <p>“Leave behind those who left,</p>
            <p>And let go of those who bid you farewell.</p>
            <p>Embrace those who came to you,</p>
            <p>And those who stayed by your side.</p>
            <p>Leave behind those who left,
                    And let go of those who bid you farewell.
                    Embrace those who came to you,
                    And those who stayed by your side.</p>
                
            <p>How narrow this vast world feels without the ones you love,
                And how vast it becomes when they are with you. </p>
                
            <p> behind those who left,
                And let go of those who bid you farewell.
                Embrace those who came to you,
                And those who stayed by your side.</p>
                
            <p>Stay true if they cherish the bond, but never be
                A companion to those who hurt you without love.</p>
                
            <p>Let go of blaming those who departed and sing for me,
                And call out to those who love life to listen to you.
                Sing to those who love life, so they may hear you.”</p>
